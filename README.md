Old College homeworks
Here are examples of past homework projects I have worked on.
The 322 course works we needed to make programs that intracted with a 15-slide puzzle(ex: http://mypuzzle.org/sliding) that would take in a test case with the puzzle and a list of moves and would either relate whether the puzzle is solvable or what the puzzle would look like after the list of moves was gone through.
